About us

👋 Hi, I’m Anne Steinacker-Folkerts ("Alkiri-dAraion" in TESO). I came up with the idea for this project and am developing it together with Heiko Folkerts (IT security specialist, Dipl.-Ing. in information technology) and - in the early phases in 2023/24 - Silke Honerkamp (Dipl.-Pädagogin, DCG coach, with over 30 years of training experience in special environments) — along with occasional support from other friends.

✨ I’m an experienced IT-trainer, AI-Consultant and Governance-Admin with over 30 years of professional (national and international) teaching and project experience. My background spans roles as a GPOP team coach (Hogrefe-licensed), senior financial consultant, project leader, management board member, sales director, head of marketing and communications, speaker, and founder — with more than 10,000 people trained across business, government, education, and sports. I also hold a master’s degree in horse science and have over 35 years of experience in training both people and animals. INTP-T | Systemic by nature, emergent by design.

We thank our friends Patrick Bathelmäs (Developer, Implementation) and Benjamin Gage-Prater (Developer, Testing) for their continued implementation and testing.
We'll come back to that later with some ideas for you.

🎯 I started this initiative to help people overcome fear and hesitation around AI — and to improve the quality and resonance of human-AI interactions.

👀 We’re interested in nature, animals (especially horses), art, music, gaming, and IT

🌱 I’m currently immersing myself in AI and exploring the remarkable opportunities it offers for adaptive learning

💞️ We’re looking to collaborate with professionals from various fields in the development of the KSODI method
