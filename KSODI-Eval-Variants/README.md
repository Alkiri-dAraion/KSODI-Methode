# KSODI Standard-Eval & Full

This directory contains the evaluation-oriented variants of the KSODI framework.

These components are designed for:

- numeric interaction observation
- drift detection
- agent-system monitoring
- governance and compliance contexts
- long-term structural stability analysis

## Variants

### KSODI Standard-Eval
Model-agnostic numeric evaluation layer.  
Designed for audit-capable and observable system environments.

### KSODI-Full
Extended analytical layer for dynamic interaction patterns, transitions and resonance structures.  
Explanatory and architectural – never decision-making.

## Intended Use

These variants are intended for:

- enterprise environments
- public administration
- regulated domains
- continuous or autonomous AI systems

## Transparency

Earlier operator drafts (e.g. v0.8) are preserved for transparency.
They reflect exploratory stages and are not representative of the current implementation architecture.
