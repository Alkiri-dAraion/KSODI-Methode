# ETHICS & INTENDED USE

## KSODI · IDAS · SIRA

## Purpose of this document

This document defines the **ethical boundaries, intended use and non-use** of the KSODI method and the IDAS Framework.

It is not a legal policy.
It is an **explicit statement of responsibility** regarding the observation, evaluation and stabilization of human–AI interaction — especially in contexts involving **autonomous or semi-autonomous agents**.

---

## Core ethical position

KSODI and IDAS are **observation frameworks**, not control systems.

They are designed to:

* make interaction behavior visible,
* detect instability and drift early,
* support human understanding and governance decisions.

They are **not** designed to:

* automate decisions,
* enforce behavior,
* judge people,
* or replace human responsibility.

---

## Tools, not weapons

KSODI treats AI systems as **tools embedded in socio-technical contexts**.

Like many tools, AI can be used in different domains:

* education,
* administration,
* healthcare,
* infrastructure,
* research,
* and yes, potentially also defense-related contexts.

The ethical distinction does **not** lie in the tool itself,
but in **how it is used, observed and governed**.

A knife can be:

* a medical instrument,
* a kitchen tool,
* or a weapon.

KSODI does not decide *what* an AI system should do.
It helps humans understand **when an AI system starts to drift away from its intended purpose**.

---

## Autonomous agents and responsibility

Autonomous or semi-autonomous agents pose specific ethical challenges:

* gradual goal drift,
* unintended task expansion,
* loss of contextual alignment,
* overconfidence without awareness,
* reduced human oversight over time.

KSODI and IDAS address these risks by:

* observing interaction structure over time,
* detecting early signs of drift,
* supporting human-in-the-loop oversight,
* and enabling intervention **before harm occurs**.

Responsibility always remains with:

* the designers,
* the operators,
* and the organizations deploying such systems.

---

## Observation over control

A central ethical principle of KSODI is:

> **Observation must never silently turn into control.**

Therefore:

* KSODI does not operate covertly,
* does not infer hidden intentions,
* does not profile individuals,
* and does not act without human awareness.

All measurements are:

* explicit,
* explainable,
* and based on observable interaction patterns only.

---

## Privacy and data minimization

Ethical AI governance requires restraint.

KSODI and IDAS:

* do not require access to chat content,
* do not store semantic meaning,
* do not analyze personal data.

They operate on:

* numeric indicators,
* temporal patterns,
* and structural change.

This minimizes harm while maximizing insight.

---

## Defense, safety and sensitive domains

KSODI does not exclude sensitive domains by default.

However, its ethical use in such contexts requires:

* explicit human oversight,
* clear purpose limitation,
* transparent governance structures,
* and documented intervention thresholds.

KSODI may support **safety and stabilization**,
but must never be used to legitimize autonomous harm.

---

## Explicit non-use

KSODI and IDAS are **not compatible** with:

* autonomous lethal decision-making,
* covert behavioral manipulation,
* social scoring or hidden profiling,
* ideological enforcement,
* authoritarian control mechanisms,
* or systems designed to bypass human accountability.

Any such use contradicts the intent of the framework.

---

## Ongoing responsibility

Ethics is not static.

This document reflects the current understanding and responsibility of the authors.
It will be revised as:

* systems evolve,
* new risks emerge,
* and governance requirements change.

Critical feedback is explicitly welcome.

---

## Closing note

KSODI exists because complexity grows faster than certainty.

Ethical responsibility begins **before** control,
and **long before** harm.

Observation, transparency and humility
are the foundations of responsible human–AI interaction.
