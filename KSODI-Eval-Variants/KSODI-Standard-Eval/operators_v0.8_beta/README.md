# Deprecation Notice

Draft / superseded by v1.0
Not normative / not implementation ready
Variable naming is preliminary

## Operators v0.8 (Draft – Archived Development Stage)

This directory contains an earlier developmental version of the KSODI operator structure.

Version 0.8 reflects an intermediate conceptual state prior to:
- the formal separation of KSODI-Light, Standard-Eval and Full,
- the integration of operator Z,
- the resolution of overlapping operator notation,
- and the finalized mathematical formalization (v1.0).

This version is preserved for transparency and version traceability.
It does not represent the current implementation-ready or governance-aligned structure of KSODI.

For the refined and structurally separated operator definitions,
please refer to operators_v1.0.
