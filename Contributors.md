About us

👋 Hi, I’m Anne Steinacker-Folkerts ("Alkiri-dAraion" in TESO). I came up with the idea for this project and am developing it together with Heiko Folkerts (IT security specialist, Dipl.-Ing. information technology) and - in the early phases in 2023/24 - Silke Honerkamp (Dipl.-Pädagogin, DCG coach, with over 30 years of training experience in special environments) — along with occasional support from other friends.

✨ I’m an experienced IT-trainer, AI-Consultant and Governance-Admin with over 30 years of professional (national and international) teaching and project experience. My background spans roles as a GPOP team coach (Hogrefe-licensed), senior financial consultant, project leader, management board member, sales director, head of marketing and communications, speaker, and founder — with more than 10,000 people trained across business, government, education, and sports. I also hold a master’s degree in horse science and have over 35 years of experience in training both people and animals. 
=> INTP-T | Systemic by nature, emergent by design.

We thank our friends Patrick Bathelmäs (Developer, Implementation) and Benjamin Gage-Prater (Developer, Testing) for their continued implementation and testing.

🎯 I started this initiative to help people overcome fear and hesitation around AI — and to improve the quality and resonance of human-AI interactions.

👀 We’re interested in nature, animals (especially horses), art, music, gaming, and IT

🌱 I’m currently immersing myself in AI and exploring the remarkable opportunities it offers for adaptive learning

💞️ We’re looking to collaborate with professionals from various fields in the development of the KSODI method

## Origin of the KSODI Method (Short Context)

The KSODI method originated from a very practical question arising in real-world communication contexts:  
🧐 Why do misunderstandings, ambiguity and instability persist in human–AI interaction even when systems appear technically correct?

The initial concept was developed by Anne in **late 2023 / early 2024** under the working title **DOSI**.  
It emerged from professional discussions around communication, structure and responsibility in administrative and organizational environments.

Early on, it became clear that interaction does not exist without **context and framing**.  
Classical communication theory — shaped by thinkers such as Paul Watzlawick, Friedemann Schulz von Thun and Hartmut Rosa — provided important insights, but also revealed its limits when applied to machines.

In discussions with Silke, one key realization crystallized:  
“*You cannot not communicate*” may hold true for humans — but it does not translate directly to machines.  
Machines do not begin with meaning; they begin with an **impulse**.

Between 2023 and 2025, the method evolved slowly and iteratively — through day and night reflections, practical experimentation, and yes, sometimes even dreams about mathematics — into what is now known as **KSODI**.  
The focus shifted toward **observable interaction structure**, rather than content, intention or correctness.

A central insight during this phase was that meaningful evaluation requires stepping back from both:
- a purely developer-centric signal perspective, and
- a purely user-centric communication perspective.

Only by observing interaction *across* the five KSODI operators did the relative nature of reference frames, goal spaces and drift become visible. 

During this phase, the ideas were shared with **OpenAI**.  
They **acknowledged the structural approach and broader implications of the work**, noting in particular the clarity of the framework, the relevance of Whitelistening, and the focus on trust, continuity and user-visible safeguards:
- *"Your insights, observations and the structured approach"*
- *"We´ve noted all the points you´ve raised, including the technical observations, proposed improvements, and the broader implications for trust and continuity"*
- *"Your KSODI framework and the concept of Whitelistening provide valuable context"*
- *"your proposed solutions like project-level voice locking and user-visible warnings are particularly helpful"*
- *"Your work with ELKIM(GPT) is a testament to what´s possible when AI is integrated into long-term, meaningful flows"*

Throughout the summer of 2025, Anne and Patrick revisited, evaluated and refined what had already been built — adding small but crucial pieces with each review cycle.  
Toward the end of 2025, a decisive internal breakthrough occurred in a discussion with Heiko:

Machines operate along a signal-oriented path (**I → D → O → S → K**),  
while humans think and communicate in the opposite direction (**K → S → O → D → I**).

🤓 This realization led to a fundamental clarification:  
Neither classical communication theory nor signal theory alone is sufficient.  
KSODI only works when both perspectives are used **together**, in the right direction, and within a shared internal geometry — the *semantic KSODI space* between human and machine.

The next question followed naturally:  
What if intention, direction and target space could be described — even with reduced precision — within a **five-dimensional observation space**?

Would that be sufficient for early drift detection?  
For a judge-model?  
For a human-in-the-loop?  
For governance and compliance?

Or, more practically:  
Could it help developers detect early when an autonomous orthopedic purchasing agent suddenly starts ordering chicken feed — or cardiology medication?

This perspective ultimately formed the basis for embedding KSODI into the broader **IDAS Framework**, enabling governance-oriented observation, explainability and early detection of drift in continuous and agent-based systems.

We are still testing, observing and learning — and remain open to additional perspectives and critical feedback.
