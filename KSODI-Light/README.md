# KSODI-Light

KSODI-Light is the human-facing variant of the KSODI observation model.

It supports:

- clearer prompt formulation
- explainability
- AI literacy development
- structured reflection on interaction quality

KSODI-Light does not evaluate correctness and does not judge users.
It supports learning and clarity.

## Scope

Suitable for:

- individual users
- training contexts
- educational environments
- organizations introducing structured AI usage

This variant can be used independently of the full governance framework.
