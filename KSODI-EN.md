# Cluster 4: What Is Missing Today? Why KSODI Became Necessary

## 1. Introduction
Discussion of existing methods for evaluating questions in human-AI interactions and their limitations.

## 2. Development from DOSI to KSODI
Explanation of the evolution from the DOSI method to KSODI.  
The English translation helped to define the dimensions **D** (Clarity) and **I** (Information Depth) more precisely in German.  
The method’s essence remained unchanged, but linguistic clarification improved its precision.

## 3. KSODI Dimensions: German / English Comparison

| Letter | German             | English            | Explanation                                                                  |
|:------:|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **K**  | Kontext             | Context            | Direct translation: thematic, factual, and situational framework.             |
| **S**  | Struktur            | Structure          | Direct translation: logical structure and argumentative coherence.            |
| **O**  | Objektivität        | Objectivity        | Direct translation: checks for neutrality vs. bias/suggestion.                 |
| **D**  | Deutlichkeit        | Clarity            | *Not* "Distinctness" — "Clarity" is more intuitive in English; it means linguistic precision. |
| **I**  | Informationsgehalt  | Information Depth  | *Not* just "Information" — emphasizes depth and completeness of content.       |

## 4. Reasoning for Terminology Adjustments
- **Deutlichkeit → Clarity:** "Clarity" is more intuitive in English and better reflects linguistic precision.  
- **Informationsgehalt → Information Depth:** Highlights the depth and completeness of information, not merely its presence.

## 5. Integration of the "Primacy of the Question"
Introduction of the "Primacy of the Question" as a central KSODI principle.  
It shapes the method’s architecture and elevates the importance of question quality.

## 6. Conclusion
KSODI emerged to address critical gaps in existing evaluation methods.  
The precise definition of the dimensions and the "Primacy of the Question" make KSODI an effective method for assessing questions in human-AI interactions.
